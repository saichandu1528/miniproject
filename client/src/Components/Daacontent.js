                <h3>What is meant by Algorithm Analysis?</h3>
<p>Algorithm analysis refers to how to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm in terms of time and space complexity. The fundamental purpose of algorithm evaluation is to decide how much time and space an<br/> algorithm needs to solve the problem as a feature of the scale of the input. The time complexity of an algorithm is typically measured in phrases of the wide variety of simple operations <br/>(which includes comparisons, assignments, and mathematics operations) that the algorithm plays at the enter records. The spatial complexity of an algorithm refers to the quantity of reminiscence the algorithm needs <br/>to solve the problem as a function of the size of the input. Algorithm analysis is crucial because it facilitates us to examine different strategies and pick the best one for a given problem. It additionally enables us pick out overall performance issues and improve algorithms to enhance their overall performance. <br/>There are many approaches to research the time and space of algorithms, together with big O notation, big Omega notation, and big Theta notation. These notations offer a manner to specify the increase rate of an algorithm's time or area requirements as the input length grows large.<br/></p>

        <h3>Why is Algorithm Analysis important?</h3>
<p>To forecast the behavior of an algorithm without putting it into action on a specific computer.<br/>
It is far more convenient to have basic metrics for an algorithm's efficiency than to develop the algorithm and access its efficiency each time a specific parameter in the underlying computer system changes.
It is hard to predict an algorithm's exact behavior. There are far too many variables to consider.<br/>
As a result, the analysis is simply an approximation; it is not perfect.<br/>
More significantly, by comparing several algorithms, we can identify which one is ideal for our needs.</p>




    <h3>Complexity of Algorithm</h3>
The term algorithm complexity measures how many steps are required by the algorithm to solve the given problem. It evaluates the order of count of operations executed by an algorithm as a function of input data size.<br/>

To assess the complexity, the order (approximation) of the count of operation is always considered instead of counting the exact steps.<br/>

O(f) notation represents the complexity of an algorithm, which is also termed as an Asymptotic notation or "Big O" notation. Here the f corresponds to the function whose size is the same as that of the input data.<br/> The complexity of the asymptotic computation O(f) determines in which order the resources such as CPU time, memory, etc. are consumed by the algorithm that is articulated as a function of the size of the input data.<br/>

<h3>Typical Complexities of an Algorithm</h3>

<b>Constant Complexity:</b>
    <p>It imposes a complexity of O(1). It undergoes an execution of a constant number of steps like 1, 5, 10, etc. for solving a given problem. The count of operations is independent of the input data size.</p>
    <b>Logarithmic Complexity:</b>
    <p>It imposes a complexity of O(log(N)). It undergoes the execution of the order of log(N) steps. To perform operations on N elements, it often takes the logarithmic base as 2.</p>
    <p>For N = 1,000,000, an algorithm that has a complexity of O(log(N)) would undergo 20 steps (with a constant precision). Here, the logarithmic base does not hold a necessary consequence for the operation count order, so it is usually omitted.</p>
    
<p>It imposes a complexity of O(N). It encompasses the same number of steps as that of the total number of elements to implement an operation on N elements.</p>
<p>For example, if there exist 500 elements, then it will take about 500 steps. Basically, in linear complexity, the number of elements linearly depends on the number of steps. For example, the number of steps for N elements can be N/2 or 3*N.
It also imposes a run time of O(n*log(n)). It undergoes the execution of the order N*log(N) on N number of elements to solve the given problem.</p>
For a given 1000 elements, the linear complexity will execute 10,000 steps for solving a given problem.
Quadratic Complexity: It imposes a complexity of O(n2). For N input data size, it undergoes the order of N2 count of operations on N number of elements for solving a given problem.
<p>If N = 100, it will endure 10,000 steps. In other words, whenever the order of operation tends to have a quadratic relation with the input data size, it results in quadratic complexity. For example, for N number of elements, the steps are found to be in the order of 3*N2/2.
Cubic Complexity: It imposes a complexity of O(n3). For N input data size, it executes the order of N3 steps on N elements to solve a given problem.
For example, if there exist 100 elements, it is going to execute 1,000,000 steps.</p>
Exponential Complexity: It imposes a complexity of O(2n), O(N!), O(nk), â€¦. For N elements, it will execute the order of count of operations that is exponentially dependable on the input data size.
For example, if N = 10, then the exponential function 2N will result in 1024. Similarly, if N = 20, it will result in 1048 576, and if N = 100, it will result in a number having 30 digits. The exponential function N! grows even faster; for example, if N = 5 will result in 120. Likewise, if N = 10, it will result in 3,628,800 and so on.
Since the constants do not hold a significant effect on the order of count of operation, so it is better to ignore them. Thus, to consider an algorithm to be linear and equally efficient, it must undergo N, N/2 or 3*N count of operation, respectively, on the same number of elements to solve a particular problem.
